Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It is widely used in web development (e.g., Ruby on Rails) and scripting.

To run Ruby::

Install Ruby from ruby-lang.org
$Run the Ruby script using:
               ##   ruby filename.rb
$Use Interactive Ruby (IRB) for quick testing:
               ##   irb
 

 ## extention file save with
     file_name.rb

## stop execution of ruby 
  use {exit}


## everything in ruby are a act like as object
   Everything in Ruby is an object, including numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, and even methods and classes.
 
   Ruby follows a pure object-oriented approach, meaning even primitive data types behave like objects and have built-in methods."
